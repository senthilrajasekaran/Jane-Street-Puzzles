# Jane Street Puzzles
 Puzzles from https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/current-puzzle/


The company 'Jane Street' makes some rather interesting mathematical/logic/wordplay based puzzles. They're known for their high dififculty, and that's what drew me into them originally.

I've been solving these puzzles for a while now -- I'm actually one of the website's most consistent solvers.  Some of the puzzles required code, which I wanted to archive here.

Although I've been doing this for some years now, some of the files are on my old computer and so I can't really access them. None of these files are really written to be read, they more just contain scratchwork and eventual solutions at this point. I may go back and clarify some of the more interesting ones later on.

The puzzles are indexed by month and year. So, for example, July 2024 would refer to this one: https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/many-happy-returns-index/, which can be found in this archive : https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/archive/
