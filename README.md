# Jane Street Puzzles
 Puzzles from https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/current-puzzle/


The company 'Jane Street' makes some rather interesting mathematical/logic/wordplay based puzzles. They're known for their high dififculty, and that's what drew me into them originally.

I've been solving these puzzles for a while now -- I'm actually one of the website's most consistent solvers.  Some of the puzzles required code, which I wanted to archive here.

Although I've been doing this for some years now, some of the files are on my old computer and so I can't really access them. None of these files are really written to be read, they more just contain scratchwork and eventual solutions at this point. The main point here is just to archive what work I could find on this computer -- I don't want to lose the files I had before as I might have with my old computer. I may go back and turn some of the more interesting ones into full write-ups as we have in the Mechanical Puzzles repo later on. 

The puzzles are indexed by month and year. So, for example, July 2024 would refer to this one: https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/many-happy-returns-index/, which can be found in this archive : https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/archive/
